## 🛠 How I Built It

This portfolio was built with a focus on clean UI, smooth user experience, and responsiveness.

### Component-Based Architecture
 - Every section (About, Projects, Experience, Education, TechStack) is split into its own React component for scalability and maintainability.

### Styling & Layout

 - Used TailwindCSS for utility-first styling and consistent spacing.

### Animations

- Integrated GSAP for scroll-based animations.

- Used ScrollTrigger so sections animate only when in the viewport.

- Leveraged gsap.matchMedia() for responsive animations: smaller motion on mobile, more dramatic motion on desktop.

- Timeline chaining and stagger created a smooth cascading effect for titles and content.

### Responsiveness

- Used Tailwind breakpoints to adapt layout across devices.

- Animations recalculated with invalidateOnRefresh so they remain consistent on resize/rotate.

### Deployment

 -Configured GitHub Pages with Vite for a fast, production-ready build.
